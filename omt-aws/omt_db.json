Information contained in this App will be updated to reflect ongoing changes in the OMT Classification and our improved knowledge of each condition, as necessary. \n\n2) Searching for a condition - You can search for a condition by scrolling down the list as per normal or you can search for it by typing in the name of the condition. Each condition will be described by its OMT classification, description and our current understanding of etiology. \n\n3) Searching with Key Words - For those who are not familiar with the scientific terms of a condition, the search can be conducted with key words, e.g. for syndactyly, search for fused, joined or webbed fingers. \n\n4) Images & Radiographs - We have included images (and radiographs where appropriate) for each condition. Please note that the image library is not yet completed. Loading of images is internet-dependent. Each image is regularly checked for its accuracy in relation to the condition. \n\n5) Syndromes - The fourth part of the OMT is Syndromes. Each Syndrome is described by OMT Classification, hallmark features, current understanding of genetic aetiology and associated hand anomalies. We have also included the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) link for that condition, which would connect directly to the website. \n\n6) Tutorial Video - We have produced a tutorial video on how to maximise your use of this App."
